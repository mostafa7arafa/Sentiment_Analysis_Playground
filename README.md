#### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this tutorial, we explore two different methods for sentiment analysis: Vader sentiment analysis and Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

We start by importing the necessary libraries and conducting exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing Starbucks reviews. This includes data visualization to understand the distribution of ratings and explore example reviews.

#### Data Cleaning <a name="data-cleaning"></a>

Next, we clean the data by removing reviews without text and filling in missing ratings. We also add an ID column to uniquely identify each review.

#### VADER Sentiment Analysis <a name="vader-sentiment-analysis"></a>

We perform sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) library. This involves analyzing the sentiment of each review and visualizing the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

#### Hugging Face Pipeline <a name="hugging-face-pipeline"></a>

We utilize Hugging Face's transformer pipeline for sentiment analysis. This versatile tool allows us to perform sentiment analysis efficiently on the dataset.

#### Comparison <a name="comparison"></a>

We compare the performance of VADER sentiment analysis and the Hugging Face pipeline by visualizing the sentiment scores and exploring example reviews.

#### Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In conclusion, we find that the sentiment analysis pipeline from Hugging Face consistently outperforms VADER sentiment analysis. This indicates the pipeline's superior performance and reliability in sentiment analysis tasks.
